# Contributing

## Code of conduct

We follow the [Rust code of conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). Please report any concerns to a [Lead][leads].

## Chat

We chat on the github-metrics Zulip instance, found at <https://github-metrics.zulipchat.com/>.

## Review policies

- Anyone is welcome to leave a review.
- We use [bors], so don't merge by hand. If you are a reviewer, type `bors r+` instead.
- Only r+ code that you are familiar with.
- Style nits and other minor concerns are welcome, but please be courteous. Labeling things as "nit" or including a comment that makes clear that these are minor points can be helpful.

## Committers

Committer access is recognition of "significant contribution". Significant contribution represents several hours of work over multiple days:

- Implementing a moderate feature
- Non-trivial refactorings
- Issue triage and general participation
- Reviewing the code of others

Committers are expected to go "above and beyond" with respect to the Code of Conduct.

Committers have write access to the repository and r+ rights on bors.

## Leads

[leads]: https://github.com/orgs/optopodi/teams/leads

Leads of the project have final decision in case of controversy. They also make membership decisions, such as who to add or remove from the committers group.

Leads are selected from committers based on a history of major contribution and committment.
